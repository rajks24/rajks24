 ## 🔭 Current Projects
 - **[Cognito Auth API – Serverless Auth with AWS](https://github.com/rajks24/cognito-auth-api)**: This project is a Node.js-based custom authentication API built for integration with AWS Cognito. It’s designed to run on AWS Lambda, exposed via API Gateway - making it a powerful, serverless alternative to traditional backend authentication systems.
 - **[Python Web App with AWS Cognito Authentication](https://github.com/rajks24/python-webapp-with-cognito-auth)**: This project demonstrates a simple Python web application using Flask and AWS Cognito for authentication. The application supports both Hosted UI and custom login page for user authentication.
 - **[3D Shape Generator](https://github.com/rajks24/3d-shape-generator)**: This project is a 3D Shape Generator built with React and Three.js. It allows users to generate and visualize 3D shapes with number of sides and color.
 - **[LLM Transformer (Subword-Level, PyTorch)](https://github.com/rajks24/llm-transformer-subword)**: Trained a mini language model from scratch using a custom BPE tokenizer (SentencePiece) and a Transformer encoder in PyTorch. It include top-k/top-p sampling and attention visualization.
